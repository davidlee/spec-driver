# Phase 04 — Strict-flip + post-flip gate

## 1. Objective

Make the `[validation.strict] delta = true` flip verification-bearing, not vacuous. Three load-bearing pieces:

1. **Wire `--no-tolerated-aliases`** through `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace.py` → `validate_workspace(...)` → `WorkspaceValidator` → per-kind delta block validators (`validate_delta_context_inputs`, `validate_delta_risk_register`). The flag is currently accepted at the CLI but silently dropped (line 146: `_ = no_tolerated_aliases`). DEC-138-14 + F-138-23 require the flag to bind end-to-end; without wiring, the post-flip acceptance gate is a no-op.
2. **Flip `workflow.toml`**: add `[validation.strict] delta = true` + `[schema_version] delta = "0.10.0+001"` per DR-138 §11.3. Validator escalates FM cut-key presence to error post-flip; loader behaviour unchanged (loader is unconditionally tolerant per DEC-138-10).
3. **Verify the post-flip gate clean** (DR-138 §11.4): `validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases` returns 0 errors; whole-corpus `validate workspace --strict` does not regress; `complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` passes; `list deltas` smoke-check across columns.

Plus the governance closeout for §10.5 acceptance: file a concrete backlog issue (path + owner + DE-136 P04 consumption point) for the §9.5 follow-up audit per F-138-24. Without that artefact, the "follow-up audit scoped" gate item is non-falsifiable.

Phase deliverable is a workspace where:

- `--no-tolerated-aliases` actually rejects a fixture artefact carrying tolerated alias `unknown` on `context_inputs[].type` (VT-DE138-GATE-001).
- Post-flip workspace-validate baseline holds under both `--strict` and `--strict --no-tolerated-aliases` (VT-DE138-FLIP-001 has two assertion shapes per IP-138 coverage table — baseline strict + strict-on-validate enforcement).
- VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attested by operator before the toml edit lands.
- F-138-24 backlog issue exists at `.spec-driver/backlog/issues/<slug>.md` with owner + DE-136 P04 umbrella consumption point.
- `complete delta DE-138` (dry-run) passes — coverage gate reads requirements via derived `applies_to`.
- IP-138 `supekku:verification.coverage@v1` entries for VT-DE138-GATE-001, VT-DE138-FLIP-001 (both rows), VH-DE138-FLIP-001 flipped `planned` → `verified`.
- DE-138 ready for `complete delta DE-138` without `--force`.

## 3. Entrance Criteria

- [x] IP-138-P03 closed (status: completed); three sweep commits + pre-sweep tag intact (`46976634`, `2afc0833`, `717fced5`, `6a7fe70b`, `360d92d8`; tag `de-138-pre-sweep` @ `46976634`).
- [x] VA-DE138-RISK-RECON-001 closed (commit `6a7fe70b`).
- [x] VA-DE138-DRIFT-001 closed (commit `717fced5`).
- [x] `validate workspace --kind delta` clean under tolerant mode (P03 close evidence: exit 0; only pre-existing 7× audit-gate + 1× DR-030 warnings).
- [x] DE-138 status `in-progress` (held since P01 entrance).
- [ ] `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` clean under strict mode pre-wiring (DR-138 §11.2 item — establishes baseline before adding the no-tolerated dimension; if strict already regresses, fix data before wiring).
- [ ] Working tree clean before workflow.toml flip lands (so revert grain is unambiguous per §11.5A).
- [ ] OQ-138-03 carried no residual P04 obligation (resolved at P03 entrance).

## 4. Exit Criteria / Done When

- [ ] `--no-tolerated-aliases` wired through CLI → `validate_workspace(...)` → `WorkspaceValidator` → per-kind delta block validators per DEC-138-14. CLI no longer drops the flag silently (`_ = no_tolerated_aliases` removed); `validate_workspace` signature carries `accept_tolerated: bool` (or equivalent `no_tolerated_aliases: bool` — chase whichever name preserves existing call-site clarity); per-kind delta block validators are invoked from the workspace validator with the threaded value.
- [ ] VT-DE138-GATE-001 green: end-to-end CLI test demonstrates a delta carrying `context_inputs[].type = unknown` (tolerated alias) returns 0 errors under default `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` AND ≥1 error under `validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases`. Test must exercise the real CLI (Typer test harness) so the wiring is proven, not just the underlying validator.
- [ ] VT-DE138-FLIP-001 green (both IP-138 coverage rows):
  - Row 1 (FR-001 baseline): `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` returns 0 errors on in-repo corpus post-flip.
  - Row 2 (FR-002 enforcement): the same command post-flip rejects an artefact with a cut FM key (`applies_to`/`context_inputs`/`risk_register`/`outcome_summary`) — fixture or synthetic assertion proving strict-mode now binds.
- [ ] VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attested: operator confirms post-sweep workspace clean + VAs closed + GATE-001 green BEFORE the workflow.toml edit lands. Attestation captured in §9 with date + operator handle (per VH convention).
- [ ] `.spec-driver/workflow.toml` carries both keys per DR-138 §11.3:
  ```toml
  [validation.strict]
  delta = true

  [schema_version]
  delta = "0.10.0+001"
  ```
- [ ] Post-flip gate (DR-138 §11.4):
  - `validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases` returns 0 errors.
  - `validate workspace --strict` whole-corpus does not regress (only sibling-draft audit-gate warnings remain — same set as P01/P03 baseline).
  - `complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` passes coverage gate via derived `applies_to`.
  - `list deltas` smoke-check: rows render correctly under new column set (no rendering regression introduced by flip — flip touches validator path only, but defence-in-depth).
- [ ] F-138-24 follow-up tracking-artefact filed: `.spec-driver/backlog/issues/<slug>.md` (or equivalent — `spec-driver create issue` is canonical) with explicit owner, due date (or "next umbrella audit"), and DE-136 P04 umbrella audit consumption point. Issue ID recorded in §9 and referenced from DR-138 §10.5 acceptance row at close.
- [ ] IP-138 `supekku:verification.coverage@v1` entries flipped `planned` → `verified` for VT-DE138-GATE-001, VT-DE138-FLIP-001 (both rows), VH-DE138-FLIP-001. Notes field updated with phase commit SHA + attestation date.
- [ ] IP-138 §9 Progress Tracking — tick `P04 — Strict-flip held; post-flip gate clean; follow-up audit tracking-artefact filed`; tick `complete delta DE-138 succeeds without --force` after the close-change handoff.
- [ ] DE-138.md frontmatter `updated:` refreshed; no scope changes expected at P04 close.
- [ ] `just check` clean (ruff + format + pytest) post-flip; `uvx import-linter lint` 3/3 contracts (workspace.py + validator.py edits are presentation/supekku-side; Migrations isolation untouched, full lint is exit gate).
- [ ] DE-138 ready for `complete delta DE-138` without `--force` (handoff to `/close-change`, not executed in this phase).

## 5. Verification

- **Unit suites**:
  - `supekku/scripts/lib/validation/validator_test.py` — extend with `accept_tolerated=False` propagation cases for per-kind delta block validators (assert WorkspaceValidator invokes `validate_delta_context_inputs(..., accept_tolerated=False)` when the flag is set).
  - `supekku/scripts/lib/blocks/delta_metadata_test.py` — already covers `accept_tolerated` at the per-kind validator boundary; no new VTs expected unless workspace-side wiring surfaces a gap.
- **Integration / end-to-end CLI**:
  - `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace_test.py` — VT-DE138-GATE-001: fixture workspace containing a delta with `context_inputs[{type: unknown, ...}]`; assert `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` exit 0 and `validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases` exit 1 with an error message mentioning the offending field/value.
  - `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace_test.py` (or live workspace assertion at `just check`) — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 1: post-flip `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` returns 0 errors against in-repo corpus.
  - Synthetic / fixture assertion — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 2: post-flip, a delta with a cut FM key (e.g. `applies_to: {specs: [PROD-004]}` re-introduced in fixture) fails with strict-mode error.
- **Tooling/commands**:
  - `uv run spec-driver validate workspace --kind delta --strict` (pre-wiring baseline — entrance gate item).
  - `uv run spec-driver validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases` (post-wiring + post-flip gate).
  - `uv run spec-driver validate workspace --strict` (whole-corpus regression check).
  - `uv run spec-driver complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` (coverage gate verification).
  - `uv run spec-driver list deltas` (smoke-check rendering).
  - `uv run spec-driver create issue` (F-138-24 backlog issue).
  - `just check` + `uvx import-linter lint` final gate.
- **Evidence to capture**:
  - Pre-wiring `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` baseline output in §10.
  - VT-DE138-GATE-001 test output (both assertion shapes) in §10.
  - VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attestation: date + operator handle in §9.
  - Workflow.toml flip commit SHA in §9; diff scope in §10 (should be a 4-line addition under two sections — no other changes).
  - Post-flip command outputs (FLIP-001 baseline + strict-on-validate fixture + whole-corpus regression check + complete dry-run + list smoke) in §10.
  - F-138-24 issue ID + path in §9; cross-reference into DR-138 §10.5 acceptance row at close.

## 6. Assumptions & STOP Conditions

- **Assumptions**:
  - `MetadataValidator.validate(..., accept_tolerated=False)` already rejects tolerated alias entries as errors (confirmed at `supekku/scripts/lib/blocks/metadata/validator.py:408`). Wiring task is plumbing — no new validator logic needed at the metadata layer.
  - `WorkspaceValidator` does not currently invoke `validate_delta_context_inputs` / `validate_delta_risk_register` at the per-kind level (grep across `supekku/scripts/lib/validation/` returned no call sites). The wiring task therefore has two layers: (1) thread `accept_tolerated` through `validate_workspace(...)` + `WorkspaceValidator` constructor; (2) actually invoke per-kind delta block validators inside `WorkspaceValidator.validate()`. If invocation already exists via another path, only layer (1) is needed — confirm during 4.1 design pass.
  - Workflow.toml is the canonical strict-mode toggle; `validate workspace --strict` CLI flag is for one-off override, not for the persistent baseline. The flip is a config edit, not a CLI invocation change.
  - In-repo corpus is already strict-clean modulo tolerated aliases (P03 swept all 141 deltas; tolerant validate is exit 0; the only remaining "strict" delta is the tolerated alias `unknown` entries on DE-006 context_inputs surfaced under `--no-tolerated-aliases`).
  - F-138-24 backlog issue belongs in `.spec-driver/backlog/issues/` (canonical location per glossary); use `spec-driver create issue` (not hand-authoring) for ID allocation + frontmatter shape.
  - VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attestation is operator-driven (the user); agent surfaces the pre-flip checklist + waits for explicit attestation before staging the workflow.toml edit. Attestation form: user types confirmation in conversation; agent records date + handle in §9.
- **STOP** when:
  - Pre-wiring `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` shows errors that are NOT just the known tolerated-alias surface — halt; data needs fixing before wiring lands (otherwise the post-flip gate captures pre-existing rot, not wiring correctness).
  - VT-DE138-GATE-001 cannot be constructed because the per-kind validator wiring does not exist anywhere in `WorkspaceValidator` and adding it surfaces design questions (where in the validate loop? before or after FM validation?) — `/consult` before improvising; this is the load-bearing piece of DEC-138-14.
  - Post-wiring `validate workspace --kind delta --strict --no-tolerated-aliases` flags entries beyond the known DE-006 tolerated alias surface — halt; investigate whether the wiring is over-eager or whether the corpus carries a previously-hidden defect. Either way, do not flip the toml.
  - Whole-corpus `validate workspace --strict` post-flip surfaces NEW errors against non-delta kinds — halt; flip should not affect non-delta kinds, so a regression here implies wiring leaked across kind boundaries. Revert per §11.5A (one-line workflow.toml revert) and investigate.
  - `complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` fails post-flip — halt; coverage gate via derived `applies_to` was proven at P03 (VT-DE138-COV-001), so a regression implies the flip surfaced a previously-tolerated validation issue. Investigate without reverting unless the failure is structural.
  - VH-DE138-FLIP-001 not attested before the workflow.toml edit is staged — halt; the attestation is the gate. Do not improvise operator approval.
  - F-138-24 backlog issue cannot be filed because the DE-136 P04 umbrella audit consumption point is unclear — halt; without a concrete consumption point, the §9.5 gate item is non-falsifiable per F-138-24 rationale.
  - Workflow.toml edit lands but `--no-tolerated-aliases` still no-ops at the CLI (i.e. the wiring task missed a layer) — halt; revert toml flip; the gate is vacuous without real wiring.

### Task Details

- **4.1 — Pre-wiring strict baseline**
  - **Design**: One CLI invocation, capture stdout/stderr/exit code. Expected: exit 0 with only pre-existing 7× audit-gate + 1× DR-030 warnings (same as tolerant baseline at P03 close). If errors surface that are NOT tolerated-alias-related, STOP and investigate.
  - **Files**: None (read-only).
  - **Testing**: Captured output is the reference baseline for 4.6 assertion.
- **4.2 — `--no-tolerated-aliases` wiring (DEC-138-14)**
  - **Design / Approach**:
    1. **CLI layer** (`spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace.py`): delete `_ = no_tolerated_aliases` (line 146); pass `accept_tolerated=not no_tolerated_aliases` (or equivalent) into `validate_ws(...)`. Update the existing `try` block at line 136 to carry the new kwarg.
    2. **validator entry** (`supekku/scripts/lib/validation/validator.py:626`): add `accept_tolerated: bool = True` keyword-only parameter to `validate_workspace(...)`; forward into `WorkspaceValidator(workspace, strict=..., fix=..., accept_tolerated=...)`.
    3. **WorkspaceValidator**: add `accept_tolerated: bool = True` to `__init__`; store as `self._accept_tolerated`. Inside `validate()`, for each loaded delta artefact, invoke `validate_delta_context_inputs(block, strict=self._strict, accept_tolerated=self._accept_tolerated)` and `validate_delta_risk_register(block, strict=..., accept_tolerated=...)` and convert returned `list[str]` into `ValidationIssue` entries with level `error` (since `accept_tolerated=False` upgrades tolerated_alias from warning to error per `MetadataValidator` semantics). Confirm where in `validate()` the delta iteration lives (or add it) — keep the call site cohesive with existing per-kind validation patterns.
    4. **Boundary check**: per-kind invocation should not run for non-delta kinds; the validator is scoped to delta blocks. Non-delta kinds (spec, audit, etc.) are unaffected by `--no-tolerated-aliases` until their own DE-139..142 wiring lands.
  - **Files**: `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace.py`, `supekku/scripts/lib/validation/validator.py`.
  - **Testing**: 4.3 (VT-DE138-GATE-001) is the end-to-end proof; unit-level test in `validator_test.py` for the parameter propagation is recommended but not strictly required if the CLI test exercises the full chain.
  - **Observations**: Confirm with grep during 4.2 design pass whether `WorkspaceValidator` already invokes any per-kind block validator (the boot survey found none in `validation/*.py`). If a different module wires block validation into the workspace flow, integrate there rather than duplicating; per-kind block validator invocation should have exactly one call site to avoid drift.
- **4.3 — VT-DE138-GATE-001**
  - **Design**: Typer test harness invocation (`typer.testing.CliRunner` against `spec_driver.presentation.cli.validate.app`). Two assertions:
    - Setup: temp workspace fixture with one delta carrying a `supekku:delta.context_inputs@v1` block where one entry has `type: unknown` (the tolerated alias per DR-138 §5.1).
    - Assertion 1: `runner.invoke(app, ["workspace", "--kind", "delta", "--strict"])` → exit code 0; no error-severity diagnostic mentioning the offending field.
    - Assertion 2: `runner.invoke(app, ["workspace", "--kind", "delta", "--strict", "--no-tolerated-aliases"])` → exit code 1; ≥1 error-severity diagnostic referencing the field.
  - **Files**: `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace_test.py` (new test class `TestGateVTDE138GATE001` or similar).
  - **Testing**: Test itself is the VT.
- **4.4 — VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attestation**
  - **Design**: Agent surfaces DR-138 §11.2 pre-flip checklist in conversation:
    - P03 sweep applied; pre-sweep tag intact (verifiable via `git tag -l de-138-pre-sweep`).
    - Sweep commit is discrete; drift log + reconciliation in separate commits.
    - VA-DE138-RISK-RECON-001 + VA-DE138-DRIFT-001 both closed (P03 evidence).
    - `validate workspace --kind delta` clean tolerant (P03 evidence).
    - `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` clean strict (4.1 baseline).
    - `--no-tolerated-aliases` wiring landed (4.2 done) + VT-DE138-GATE-001 green (4.3 done).
    - Operator confirms by typing explicit attestation (e.g. "VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attested" or equivalent). Agent records date + handle in §9 Decisions.
  - **Files**: None (conversational gate).
  - **Testing**: Attestation is the verification artefact (VH = Verification by Human per glossary).
- **4.5 — Flip workflow.toml**
  - **Design**: Read current `.spec-driver/workflow.toml`; append two sections after the existing content per DR-138 §11.3:
    ```toml
    [validation.strict]
    delta = true

    [schema_version]
    delta = "0.10.0+001"
    ```
    If the file already has a `[validation.strict]` or `[schema_version]` section (it may not), MERGE the key under the existing section rather than duplicating the header. Commit as a discrete commit (no other staged changes) so revert grain is clean per §11.5A. Commit message: `feat(DE-138): IP-138-P04 strict-flip — workflow.toml [validation.strict] delta=true + [schema_version] delta=0.10.0+001`.
  - **Files**: `.spec-driver/workflow.toml`.
  - **Testing**: 4.6/4.7/4.8 collectively prove the flip held.
- **4.6 — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 1 (baseline)**
  - **Design**: `uv run spec-driver validate workspace --kind delta --strict` post-flip. Expected: exit 0; output identical to 4.1 baseline (only pre-existing 7× audit-gate + 1× DR-030 warnings). If `--strict` now surfaces NEW errors (something the flip exposed), STOP per §6 — likely a P03 sweep miss or a tolerated-alias surface beyond the known DE-006 entries. Revert per §11.5A if data needs fixing.
  - **Files**: None (read-only).
  - **Testing**: Captured output mirrors 4.1 baseline byte-for-byte (modulo timestamps).
- **4.7 — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 2 (strict-on-validate enforcement)**
  - **Design**: Fixture-based: construct a temp workspace with a delta whose FM carries a cut key (e.g. `applies_to: {specs: [PROD-004]}` re-introduced). Run `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` against the fixture and assert exit 1 with an error message identifying the cut key as forbidden post-flip. Test lives alongside GATE-001 in `workspace_test.py`. This row of FLIP-001 is the strict-on-validate FR-002 proof; without it, FLIP-001 only proves "the corpus does not regress", not "strict mode is actually enforced".
  - **Files**: `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace_test.py`.
  - **Testing**: Test itself is the VT row.
- **4.8 — Post-flip gate**
  - **Design**: Three CLI invocations:
    1. `uv run spec-driver validate workspace --strict` (whole corpus). Expected: no NEW errors vs the pre-flip whole-corpus baseline; only sibling-draft audit-gate warnings remain.
    2. `uv run spec-driver complete delta DE-138 --dry-run`. Expected: coverage gate via derived `applies_to` returns no missing coverage (P03 VT-DE138-COV-001 evidence held).
    3. `uv run spec-driver list deltas` smoke-check. Expected: rows render without exceptions; column matrix unchanged from P03 LIST-001 baseline.
  - **Files**: None (read-only).
  - **Testing**: Outputs captured in §10.
- **4.9 — F-138-24 backlog issue**
  - **Design**: `uv run spec-driver create issue "audit delta-vs-IP verification asymmetry"` (or equivalent CLI shape — check `spec-driver create --help` for the exact subcommand). Populate frontmatter with:
    - `owner`: TBD (operator decision at filing — may be deferred to umbrella audit if no individual owner identified, in which case set to "DE-136 P04 umbrella audit").
    - `due`: explicit date or "next umbrella audit" sentinel (per F-138-24 — concrete date or sentinel, not blank).
    - Body content per DR-138 §9.5 + §15.1: audit shape (sample delta §6 prose; characterise drift patterns + root cause; output scopes corrective surface across skills/validation/memory).
    - DE-136 P04 umbrella audit consumption point: explicit cross-reference in body (e.g. "Consumed by DE-136 P04 umbrella audit per DR-138 §15.1 + F-138-24").
    - Cross-references back: DR-138 §10.5 acceptance row should reference the issue ID at close (4.10 reconciliation task).
  - **Files**: `.spec-driver/backlog/issues/<slug>.md` (created via CLI).
  - **Testing**: `uv run spec-driver list issues` shows the new entry; ID recorded in §9.
- **4.10 — Execution-doc reconciliation**
  - **Design**:
    - IP-138 `supekku:verification.coverage@v1` — flip `planned` → `verified` for VT-DE138-GATE-001 (FR-002, P04), VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 1 (FR-001, P04), VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 2 (FR-002, P04), VH-DE138-FLIP-001 (FR-002, P04). Update `notes` field on each entry to reference the relevant commit SHA + test ID.
    - IP-138 §9 Progress Tracking — tick `P04 — Strict-flip held; post-flip gate clean; follow-up audit tracking-artefact filed`. Leave `complete delta DE-138 succeeds without --force` for `/close-change` to tick.
    - DE-138.md frontmatter — refresh `updated:` date.
    - notes.md — append `## 2026-05-20 — P04 close — Strict-flip + post-flip gate` with: wiring commit SHA, flip commit SHA, VH attestation date + operator handle, VT-DE138-GATE-001 + FLIP-001 (both rows) test references, F-138-24 issue ID + path, post-flip gate output summary, final test count.
    - Optional: cross-reference F-138-24 issue ID into DR-138 §10.5 acceptance row + §15.1 (mark "tracking artefact filed: ISSUE-XXX").
  - **Files**: `IP-138.md`, `DE-138.md`, `notes.md`, optionally `DR-138.md`.
  - **Testing**: `validate workspace --kind delta` clean post-reconciliation (no broken references introduced).
- **4.11 — Quality gates**
  - **Design**: `just check` (ruff + format + pytest) — expect 5386 + new GATE-001 + FLIP-001 row 2 tests + any per-kind wiring tests from 4.2 (rough estimate +3-5 VTs). `uvx import-linter lint` 3/3 contracts — wiring touches `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace.py` (allowed to import supekku) and `supekku/scripts/lib/validation/validator.py` (supekku-side, no migration concerns); Migrations isolation contract unaffected. Capture final test count in §10.
  - **Files**: None (verification).

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wiring lands at CLI + validator entry but never invokes per-kind delta block validators inside `WorkspaceValidator.validate()` — flag plumbs through but the gate is still vacuous | 4.3 VT-DE138-GATE-001 is end-to-end via CLI; if the test passes, the wiring is real. STOP per §6 if 4.3 fails despite 4.2 marked done | open |
| Pre-wiring `--strict` baseline (4.1) surfaces errors beyond the known tolerated-alias surface — indicates P03 sweep miss or undocumented validation issue | §3 entrance gate; §6 STOP halts before wiring lands; investigate without flipping toml | open |
| Workflow.toml flip lands before VH attestation captured — operator approval bypassed | 4.4 explicitly gates 4.5; agent records attestation in §9 before staging edit; §6 STOP enforces | open |
| Post-flip `validate workspace --strict` whole-corpus regresses on non-delta kinds (wiring leaked across kind boundaries) | 4.8 captures whole-corpus output; §6 STOP triggers §11.5A one-line revert; investigate scope leak | open |
| `complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` fails post-flip (coverage gate surfaces issue exposed by strict mode) | 4.8 captures dry-run output; if fails, investigate per-requirement against derived `applies_to`; revert toml only if structural defect | open |
| F-138-24 issue filed but content is generic / lacks DE-136 P04 consumption point — §10.5 gate is still non-falsifiable | 4.9 design specifies explicit consumption-point requirement; reviewer cross-checks issue body against DR-138 §9.5 + §15.1 content shape; STOP if vague | open |
| `MetadataValidator(accept_tolerated=False)` returns warnings not errors for tolerated_aliases — wiring threads correctly but assertion shape wrong | Confirmed at `validator.py:408` that `_accept_tolerated=False` produces errors; if behaviour differs in practice, treat as a metadata-layer bug requiring `/consult` (out of DE-138 scope but blocks the gate) | open |
| Per-kind block validator invocation in WorkspaceValidator already exists somewhere (different module / different shape) and the wiring task duplicates it | 4.2 design step 4 explicitly checks for existing call site via grep; if found, integrate rather than duplicate to maintain single source of truth | open |
| `[schema_version] delta = "0.10.0+001"` collides with an existing `[schema_version]` section in workflow.toml | 4.5 design checks for existing section; merge key under existing header if present, do not duplicate | open |

## 9. Decisions & Outcomes

- `YYYY-MM-DD` — Pre-wiring `validate workspace --kind delta --strict` baseline captured (4.1). Output: <exit code + error count + tolerated-alias-surface summary>.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — `--no-tolerated-aliases` wiring landed in commit `<SHA>` (4.2). Touches `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace.py` + `supekku/scripts/lib/validation/validator.py`; per-kind delta block validators (`validate_delta_context_inputs`, `validate_delta_risk_register`) invoked from `WorkspaceValidator.validate()` with `accept_tolerated` threaded through.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — VT-DE138-GATE-001 green (4.3). Test path: `spec_driver/presentation/cli/validate/workspace_test.py::<class>::<test>`. Both assertion shapes pass; flag is no longer silently dropped.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — VH-DE138-FLIP-001 attested by `<operator handle>` (4.4). Pre-flip checklist (DR-138 §11.2) confirmed item-by-item; attestation captured in conversation.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — Workflow.toml flip commit `<SHA>` (4.5). Discrete commit; only `.spec-driver/workflow.toml` mutated. Diff scope: two sections added — `[validation.strict] delta = true` + `[schema_version] delta = "0.10.0+001"`.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 1 green (4.6). Post-flip `validate workspace --kind delta --strict`: exit 0; output matches pre-wiring baseline byte-for-byte modulo timestamps.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — VT-DE138-FLIP-001 row 2 green (4.7). Synthetic fixture with cut FM key fails post-flip with strict-mode error.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — Post-flip gate clean (4.8): whole-corpus `validate workspace --strict` no regression; `complete delta DE-138 --dry-run` passes; `list deltas` rows render unchanged.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — F-138-24 backlog issue filed as `ISSUE-<id>` at `.spec-driver/backlog/issues/<slug>.md` (4.9). Owner: `<value>`; due: `<value>`; DE-136 P04 umbrella audit consumption point captured in body.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — Execution-doc reconciliation complete (4.10): IP-138 coverage entries flipped to verified; PROD-004 coverage block unchanged (FR-001/-002/-007 remain `in-progress` per F-138-L — umbrella audit at DE-136 P04 promotes to verified); notes appended; DR-138 §10.5 cross-referenced to F-138-24 issue.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — Quality gates clean (4.11): `just check` <test count> pass; `uvx import-linter lint` 3/3 contracts.
