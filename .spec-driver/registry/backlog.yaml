# Backlog item priority ordering
# Generated by: spec-driver sync backlog
# Last updated: 2025-11-04
#
# This registry maintains the canonical priority order of backlog items.
# Position in the list determines priority (earlier = higher priority).
# Items are discovered from backlog/{issues,problems,improvements,risks}/ directories.
#
# Usage:
#   - spec-driver sync backlog           # Regenerate from filesystem
#   - spec-driver list backlog            # Display in priority order
#   - spec-driver list backlog --prioritize  # Interactive reordering (Phase 3)
