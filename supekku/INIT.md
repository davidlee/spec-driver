# spec-driver

This project uses spec-driver, a spec-driven development tool and framework.

## Running it

`uv run spec-driver`

Do it now, and remember the commands available.

If you are instructed later to run spec-driver (e.g. as `uvx spec-driver list adrs`), use the method above to execute the given command. 

## ADRs

Then, run `uv run spec-driver list adrs -s accepted`

Remember the list of accepted ADRS; these represent important decisions which might apply to your scope of work. 

If you're later working on anything which may intersect with an accepted ADR, you MUST 
- read it (`specify/decisions/ADR-XXX-*.md`)
- adhere to the existing decision
- If it comes into conflict with your assigned task, STOP and raise the conflict for clarification
