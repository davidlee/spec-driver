This is an excellent start for a utility library. It's clean, focused, and correctly handles the fundamental operations of reading and writing
  markdown with YAML frontmatter. The helper functions are Pythonic and useful.

  Here is my evaluation and a set of ideas for improvement and extension, keeping your "tools, not rules" philosophy in mind.

  Evaluation of the Current Library

  Strengths:
   * Clarity: The code is simple, readable, and has a clear purpose.
   * Correctness: It correctly uses yaml.safe_load and yaml.safe_dump for security and data integrity. The preservation of key order in the
     frontmatter (sort_keys=False) is a thoughtful touch.
   * Modularity: The functions are small and reusable, forming a good foundation for more complex scripts.
   * Dependency Check: The initial check for PyYAML is good practice.

  Areas for Improvement:
   * Robustness: The _split_frontmatter function is effective for well-formed files but could be brittle. A file containing \n---\n in the body
     for other reasons could lead to incorrect parsing.
   * Error Handling: The script doesn't handle potential FileNotFoundError during reads or YAMLError during parsing, which could make calling
     scripts more complex.
   * Schema Awareness: The library is currently agnostic to the rich schema you've defined in frontmatter-schema.md. It treats frontmatter as a
     generic dictionary, which is a missed opportunity for providing deeper, more intelligent tooling.

  Ideas for Improvement & Extension

  The goal is to evolve this from a simple file utility into a true "Spec API" that understands your methodology's artifacts and their
  relationships.

  Phase 1: Refining the Core

  These changes would make the existing foundation more robust and professional.

  1. Adopt a Dedicated Frontmatter Library

  Instead of manually splitting the frontmatter, using a library like python-frontmatter would make parsing more robust and handle edge cases
  automatically.

   * Rationale: Offloads parsing complexity, reduces maintenance, and provides a more standardized Post object that combines metadata and
     content.
   * Example:

    1     # pip install python-frontmatter
    2     import frontmatter
    3 
    4     def load_markdown_file(path: Path | str) -> frontmatter.Post:
    5         # This single call replaces _split_frontmatter and yaml.safe_load
    6         return frontmatter.load(path)
    7 
    8     def dump_markdown_file(path: Path | str, post: frontmatter.Post) -> None:
    9         # The library handles the serialization and file writing
   10         frontmatter.dump(post, path)
   11 
   12     # Usage
   13     # post = load_markdown_file("path/to/spec.md")
   14     # post.metadata['status'] = 'approved'
   15     # post.content += "\n## New Section"
   16     # dump_markdown_file("path/to/spec.md", post)

  2. Introduce Schema Validation

  This is the most impactful extension. The library should be the canonical source for validating artifacts against your defined schema.

   * Rationale: Enforces consistency, prevents errors, and allows agents to operate with confidence. This is the core of "tools, not rules."
   * Example: You could use a library like Pydantic or jsonschema to define your frontmatter rules.

    1     # (Conceptual example using Pydantic)
    2     from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    3     from typing import List, Literal
    4 
    5     class BaseSpec(BaseModel):
    6         id: str
    7         name: str
    8         kind: Literal['spec', 'prod', 'delta', 'audit', 'etc']
    9         status: Literal['draft', 'approved', 'active', 'superseded']
   10         # ... other common fields
   11 
   12     class TechSpec(BaseSpec):
   13         kind: Literal['spec']
   14         packages: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
   15         responsibilities: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
   16 
   17     SCHEMA_KINDS = {"spec": TechSpec, /* ... other kinds */}
   18 
   19     def validate_frontmatter(frontmatter: dict) -> BaseModel:
   20         kind = frontmatter.get("kind")
   21         if not kind or kind not in SCHEMA_KINDS:
   22             raise ValueError(f"Missing or invalid 'kind': {kind}")
   23         model = SCHEMA_KINDS[kind]
   24         return model.model_validate(frontmatter)
   25 
   26     # In load_markdown_file, you could then run:
   27     # validated_metadata = validate_frontmatter(post.metadata)

  Phase 2: Building Higher-Level Capabilities

  These features would provide powerful, high-level functions for navigating and manipulating your spec ecosystem.

  3. Create a Spec Registry/Finder

  Centralize the logic for finding specs. Agents shouldn't need to scan the filesystem; they should ask the library.

   * Rationale: Decouples agents from the physical directory structure and provides a fast, reliable way to resolve artifact IDs.
   * Example:

    1     # (Assumes a registry.json mapping ID -> file_path)
    2     class SpecFinder:
    3         def __init__(self, root_dir: Path):
    4             self._registry_path = root_dir / "doc/specify/tech/registry.json"
    5             self._registry = self._load_registry()
    6 
    7         def _load_registry(self) -> dict:
    8             # Load and cache the registry file
    9             ...
   10 
   11         def find_path_by_id(self, spec_id: str) -> Path | None:
   12             return self._registry.get(spec_id)
   13 
   14         def load_spec_by_id(self, spec_id: str) -> frontmatter.Post | None:
   15             path = self.find_path_by_id(spec_id)
   16             if path:
   17                 return load_markdown_file(path)
   18             return None

  4. Add Artifact Creation Tooling

  Port the logic from the Ruby create-new-spec.rb script into this library to provide a single, consistent interface for creating new
  artifacts.

   * Rationale: Consolidates your tooling in one language and allows different scripts to programmatically create specs, deltas, audits, etc.,
     without calling an external process.
   * Example:

    1     def create_artifact(
    2         kind: str,
    3         name: str,
    4         directory: Path,
    5         # ... other metadata
    6     ) -> Path:
    7         # 1. Determine the next available ID (e.g., SPEC-042)
    8         # 2. Load the correct template file from .specify/templates/
    9         # 3. Populate the frontmatter
   10         # 4. Create the directory and file
   11         # 5. Return the path to the new file
   12         ...

  5. Implement Relationship Management

  Provide helper functions for reading and modifying the relations field in the frontmatter.

   * Rationale: Manipulating YAML programmatically can be error-prone. Providing safe, high-level functions abstracts this away and prevents
     mistakes.
   * Example:

    1     def add_relation(
    2         spec_path: Path,
    3         type: str,
    4         target: str,
    5         annotation: str | None = None
    6     ) -> bool:
    7         post = load_markdown_file(spec_path)
    8         relations = post.metadata.setdefault("relations", [])
    9 
   10         new_relation = {"type": type, "target": target}
   11         if annotation:
   12             new_relation["annotation"] = annotation
   13 
   14         if new_relation not in relations:
   15             relations.append(new_relation)
   16             dump_markdown_file(spec_path, post)
   17             return True
   18         return False
   19 
   20     # Usage:
   21     # add_relation("path/to/DE-001.md", type="verifies", target="SPEC-002.FR-009")
