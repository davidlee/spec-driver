"""Specification domain - managing technical and product specifications.

This package handles all specification-related functionality:
- registry: SpecRegistry for discovering and accessing specs
- models: Spec dataclass and related models
- index: SpecIndexBuilder for building spec indices
- creation: Creating new specs from templates

NOTE: Block parsing (formerly specs/blocks.py) moved to:
  supekku/scripts/lib/blocks/relationships.py
  supekku/scripts/lib/blocks/verification.py

Block parsing is INFRASTRUCTURE (format extraction), not domain logic.
Domain logic that USES blocks stays here in specs/.
